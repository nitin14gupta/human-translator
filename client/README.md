# Translator Connect App

**Translator Connect** is a mobile and web application designed to bridge language and cultural gaps between international travelers and local translators in India. The app provides a seamless platform where travelers can book professional human translators for real-time assistance, fostering meaningful communication and cultural immersion. Translators can register to offer their services, creating job opportunities while showcasing their linguistic expertise.

This project aims to solve the challenges of language barriers, reliance on impersonal AI-based translation tools, and the lack of personalized cultural guidance for travelers. By combining cutting-edge technology with human expertise, Translator Connect delivers an intuitive, accessible, and scalable solution tailored to global audiences.
